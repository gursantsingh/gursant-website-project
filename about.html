      <p class="center">
        PUBG Mobile is a free-to-play battle royale video game developed by
        LightSpeed & Quantum Studio, a division of Tencent Games. It is a mobile
        game adaptation of PUBG: Battlegrounds. It was initially released for
        Android and iOS on 19 March 2018. It was published by multiple
        publishers in different regions, including Krafton, Tencent, and VNG
        Games. By December 2022, PUBG Mobile had accumulated around 1.3 billion
        downloads while grossing over $9 billion, making it the third
        highest-grossing mobile game. It is also the second most-played mobile
        video game of all time. In 2021, the game spawned an Indian version,
        Battlegrounds Mobile India, and a separate game taking place in the PUBG
        Universe, called New State Mobile.

      <h2 class="center">Gameplay</h2>
      <p class="center">
        PUBG Mobile features gameplay similar to that of the original
        PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Players parachute down to a remote island
        and fight to remain as the last player standing, competing alone or in
        teams of two or four, depending on the game mode selected before the
        match. Each match lasts about 30 minutes. It takes exactly 32 minutes
        and 50 seconds for the zone to close completely. After than, another 11
        seconds or so until you die inside the zone, so potential max of about
        33 minutes and 10 seconds if you try to heal yourself. The game begins
        with the participants flying in a plane over one of many possible maps,
        also selected before the match. As they cross the map, players choose
        where to parachute down. When the plane finishes its flight, a blue
        border forms around the perimeter of the island, marking the boundary
        between the safe zone and the exterior blue zone. The safe zone shrinks
        every few minutes, and anyone left in the blue zone will steadily lose
        health as long as they remain there, potentially to the point of death.
        The rate of health loss increases when the safe zone shrinks. When
        players first reach the island with no supplies or weapons, they must
        find them around their environment or loot them from downed players. In
        general, better weapons and equipment are found in more dangerous parts
        of the map.[4] In addition to the regular shrinking of the safe zone,
        temporary red zones may randomly appear to be barraged with bombs, and
        from time to time, the plane flies over the battlefield to release a
        package with special equipment, potentially including items that cannot
        be found elsewhere on the island. All of these special events, including
        the normal safe zone shrinking, are announced to the players before they
        occur to give a fair warning. Additional features unique to the mobile
        version of PUBG include log-in bonuses, missions and micro-goals, crew
        recruiting, map and compass improvements with larger and clear markers
        near the teammates, and an auto loot system, as well as an increased
        number of bots

        PlayerUnknownâ€™s Battlegrounds (PUBG) Mobile is the mobile adaption of
        the popular battle royale game, PUBG: Battlegrounds, developed by PUBG
        Studios and LightSpeed & Quantum Studio, published by Tencent Games
        worldwide, while Krafton and VNG Games in India, Korea and Vietnam
        respectively. The game was released in March 2018 and has since become
        one of the most popular mobile games in the world. The development of
        PUBG Mobile took just 4 months to be completed, as multiple teams from
        around the world contributing to the project. The project began with the
        original PC and console version of the game, which was developed by
        Brendan Greene (known as PlayerUnknown) and released in 2017. Following
        the success of the that particular game, Tencent Games began their own
        development project with PUBG Studios for the mobile version. In doing
        so, they had to create an evolution of the Unreal Engine 4, and was
        optimized to suit the mobile platform, with a focus on smoother
        performance and enhanced graphics. An abridged version of the game for
        lower-end Android devices, PUBG Mobile Lite, was first released in
        Thailand on 24 January 2019 before releasing in Asian, Latin American,
        and African countries.

      <h2 class="center">Release</h2>
      <p class="center">
        Following the India international deal for the Windows version, Tencent
        Games and PUBG Corporation announced plans to release two mobile
        versions of the game in China. The first, PUBG: Exhilarating
        Battlefield, is an abridged version of the original game, and was
        developed by LightSpeed & Quantum Studio, an internal division of
        Tencent Games. The second, PUBG: Army Attack, includes more arcade-style
        elements, including action taking place on warships, and was developed
        by Tencent's Timi Studio. Both versions are free-to-play, and were
        released for Android and iOS devices on 9 February 2017. The games had a
        combined total of 75 million pre-registrations, and ranked first and
        second on the Chinese iOS download charts at launch. Following a soft
        launch in Canada, an English version of Exhilarating Battlefield,
        localized as PUBG Mobile, was released worldwide on 19 March 2018. PUBG
        Mobile KR, a Korean and Japanese oriented version and PUBG Mobile VN, a
        Vietnamese oriented version released in June 2018 and January 2019
        respectively. In China, PUBG Mobile had been awaiting approval by the
        government for an authorized release, during which the game could only
        be offered as a public test. However, Tencent's planned release was
        suspended due to the government approval freeze across most of 2018. By
        May 2019, Tencent announced it would no longer seek to publish PUBG
        Mobile in China, but instead would re-release the game under the title
        Game for Peace; this version of the game changed elements of the
        original game to meet China's content restrictions, such as eliminating
        blood and gore. Following its release, a Taiwanese version of the game,
        PUBG Mobile TW was released. A version meant for lower-end mobile
        devices, PUBG Mobile Lite, was released on 25 July 2019. This has
        support for high FPS gameplay on multiple Android devices, and features
        a smaller map made for 60 players. The Chinese version of the app was
        again renamed to Peacekeeper Elite in 2020.
